Predictive Model for 24-Hour Electric Charge Forecast in Algeria
Overview
This project involves the development of a predictive model to forecast the electric charge 24 hours in advance for Algeria, using data from Sonelgaz. The goal of this project is to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to provide accurate predictions that can aid in decision-making processes for power management.

Project Description
Using historical electric charge data provided by Sonelgaz, we developed a predictive model employing several machine learning algorithms. These included:

Radial Basis Function (RBF) Networks
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
Self-Organizing Map (SOM) Kohonen for Clustering
The model achieved an impressive accuracy of 92%, demonstrating its potential utility for real-world applications in the energy sector.
Results
The predictive model successfully forecasts the electric charge 24 hours in advance with a 92% accuracy rate. Detailed evaluation results and visualizations can be found in the results/ directory.
